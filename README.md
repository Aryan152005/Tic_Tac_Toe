# Tic_Tac_Toe

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe web application! This project showcases my implementation of the classic game of Tic Tac Toe using web technologies.

# Project Overview
In this project, I have developed a web-based Tic Tac Toe game that allows two players to compete against each other on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to place three marks (either "X" or "O") in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal pattern.

The web application features an intuitive user interface with a responsive game board that updates in real-time. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an interactive and enjoyable gaming experience.
 
# Features
Two-player gameplay: Players take turns making moves.
Dynamic game board: The grid updates in real-time to reflect the current game state.
Visual feedback: Highlights the winning pattern and displays the winner at the end of each round.
Restart option: Players can reset the game and start a new round.

# Demo
